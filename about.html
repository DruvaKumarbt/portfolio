          <h2>Digital Addressing system</h2>
          <h4>Android application developer</h4>
          <p>
            The manual address identification service, which is widely used
            across the country has many disadvantages regarding the
            identification of locations. As a result of the technological
            revolution, postal systems that were once viewed as efficient,
            trusted and inclusive have rapidly come to be seen as outdated,
            expensive and slow. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the
            existing manual identification service, the project aims at
            implementing geo-coding system with digital PIN code system to track
            the specific address location.
